cameraGUI
=========

A repository for the Prosilica Camera GUI.

The Edwards Bioinformatics lab is working on a wxPython interface for the Prosilica cameras. This will allow users to view and save the files from the cameras. This repository has our code as we are working on it so we can share it with each other and the world. Some of it is rough, some of it is ready, but it is all here!
